# Linear Search Time Complexity

This project analyzes how the time taken by linear search changes with different sequence lengths and search positions (Start, Middle, End).

## Features

- Randomly generates unique sequences
- Measures average search time over 1000 trials
- Plots results using matplotlib

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
